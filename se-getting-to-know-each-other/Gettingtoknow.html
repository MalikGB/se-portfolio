    <p class="SectionHeader">Introduction:</p>
    <hr class = "BottomCurve">
    <p class="MainText">Hello everyone, my name is Malik Tifah. I am a senior here at Lewis with a major in computer science. 
        My goal once I finish my degree is to get a career as a software engineer/programmer at a video game company.<br>
        Regarding my family, I lived with my parents most of my life as the only child in the house. 
        I have two brothers and a sister however, they had already moved out and begun their own lives long before I was born. 
         My 2nd oldest brother went to university to get a degree in culinary arts to become a chef, and my sister got her degree in psychology to become a therapist.

    <p class="SectionHeader">My Favorite Hobby:</p>
    <hr class = "BottomCurve">
    <p class="MainText">
        My favorite hobby is playing/making video games. While technically these are considered two hobbies, 
        I generally include them together when discussing my favorite hobby because they feed into each other. 
        The games that I play can inspire me to learn about systems that I could implement into my future projects. Also by working on projects myself, 
        I can get a better understanding/appreciation for some of the stuff that goes into making games work. 
        Because after getting into more complex stuff like pathing and AI I take a step back and think, holy heck how did they figure this sort of stuff out. </p>
