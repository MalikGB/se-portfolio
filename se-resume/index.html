    <p class="Bold"> Maze Game (Personal Project)</p>
    <p class = "Tab">• Created a maze game using the 3D objects in Unity. The game has the player traverse a maze, and either fight or avoid enemies (represented by cubes)
        that followed the player as they tried to reach the goal. This project took about 2 weeks to finish.</p>

    <p class = "Bold"> Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Personal Project)</p>
    <p class = "Tab">• Created an interactive tic-tac-toe game using Java and the JFrame library. The program opens a separate window where the user can select two game modes. 
        The game has two modes, “1P vs 2P and “1P vs CPU”. Once the user selects an option, the game opens a new window that contains the gameboard which allows the user, or the CPU, to select certain spaces
         to draw their mark. The game ends once either player gets a winning combination. This project took around 4 days to complete.</p>
