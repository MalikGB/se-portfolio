    <p class="Bold"> Maze Game (Personal Project)</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Created a maze game using the 3D objects in Unity. The game has the player traverse a maze, and either fight or avoid enemies (represented by cubes)
        that followed the player as they tried to reach the goal. This project took about 2 weeks to finish.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p class = "Bold"> Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Personal Project)</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Created an interactive tic-tac-toe game using Java and the JFrame library. The program opens a separate window where the user can select two game modes. 
        The game has two modes, &quot;1P vs 2P&quot; and &quot;1P vs CPU&quot;. Once the user selects an option, the game opens a new window that contains the gameboard which allows the user, or the CPU, to select certain spaces
         to draw their mark. The game ends once either player gets a winning combination. This project took around 4 days to complete.
